I warn and exhort you
I was astonished to learn
I was constantly watchful to
I was exceedingly interested
I was honored with the acquaintance
I was lost in admiration
I was not slow to accept and believe
I was not without some anxiety
I was overwhelmed
I was sincerely astonished
I was very much interested
I was very much thrilled
I well recollect the time
I well remember an occasion
I will accept the general proposition
I will add the memorable words
I will ask the indulgence
I will ask you to accompany me
I will ask you to bear witness
I will dwell a little longer
I will endeavor in a brief way
I will endeavor to illustrate
I will endeavor to show you
I will enlarge no further
I will even express a hope at the outset
I will even go further and say
I will first call your attention to
I will give one more illustration
I will illustrate this point by
I will merely mention
I will neither affirm nor deny
I will not allude
I will not argue this
I will not attempt to note
I will not be content until
I will not condescend to
I will not enumerate at present
I will not pause to maintain
I will not positively say
I will not pretend to inquire into
I will not quarrel with
I will not relinquish the confidence
I will not repeat the arguments here
I will not try to gauge
I will now consider with you
I will now leave this question
I will now take an instance
I will only speak to one point
I will only sum up my evidence
I will only take an occasion to express
I will only venture to remind you
I will point out to your attention
I will say at once
I will speak but a word or two more
I will speak plainly
I will state with perfect distinctness
I will suppose the objection to be
I will take one more instance
I will take the precaution to add
I will tell you what I think of
I will try to make the thing intelligible
I will venture a single remark
I will venture to add
I will venture to express the hope
I will yield the whole question
I willingly admit
I wish also to declare positively
I wish at the outset
I wish emphatically to reaffirm
I wish I had the time and the power
I wish it first observed
I wish rather to call your attention
I wish, sir, that justice might be done
I wish to ask if you honestly and candidly believe
I wish to be allowed to enforce in detail
I wish to begin my statement
I wish to confine what I have to say
I wish to do full justice to
I wish to draw your attention
I wish to express my profound gratification
I wish to give these arguments their full weight
I wish to know whether
I wish to offer a few words relative to
I wish to remind you in how large a degree
I wish to say a word or two
I wish to state all this as a matter of fact
I wish you success and happiness
I wish you to observe
I would also gratefully acknowledge
I would as soon believe
I would desire to speak simply and directly
I would enter a protest
I would further point out to you
I would have you understand
I would infinitely rather
I would like to say one word just here
I would not be understood as belittling
I would not dwell upon that matter if
I would not push the suggestion so far
I would now gladly lay before you
I would rather a thousand times
I would recommend to your consideration
I would suggest first of all
I would that my voice could reach the ear
I would urge and entreat you
I would urge upon you
I would venture to point out
I yielded to the earnest solicitations
If any man be so persuaded
If anyone could conceive
If anyone is so dim of vision
If any other answer be made
If at first view this should seem
If, however, you determine to
If I am asked for the proof
If I am wrong
If I can carry you with me
If I can succeed in describing
If I could find words
If I have done no more than view the facts
If I have in any way deserved
If I may be allowed a little criticism
If I may be allowed modestly to suggest
If I may be allowed to refer
If I may reverently say so
If I may say so without presumption
If I may so speak
If I may take for granted
If I may venture to say anything
If I mistake not the sentiment
If I recollect aright
If I understand the matter at all
If I venture a few remarks
If I were asked
If I were to act upon my conviction
If I were to recapitulate
If I wished to prove my contention
If, in consequence we find it necessary
If in the glow of conscious pride
If in the years of the future
If it be difficult to appreciate
If it be so
If it be true
If it is contended
If it means anything, it means this
If more were needed to illustrate.
If my opinions are true
If on the contrary, we all foresee
If, on the other hand, I say
If one seeks to measure
If only we go deep enough
If still you have further doubt
If the bare facts were studied
If the experience of the world is worth anything
If, then, I am asked
If, then, I should here rest my cause
If there be any among us
If there be one lesson more than another
If this be so
If this seems doubtful to anyone
If, unhappily, the day should ever come
If we accept at all the argument
If we are not blind to
If we are rightly informed
If we are to reason on the fact
If we cast our glance back
If we embark upon a career
If we had the whole case before us
If we isolate ourselves
If we may trust to experience
If we pursue a different course
If we pursue our inquiries through
If we sincerely desire
If we survey
If we would not be beguiled
If what has been said is true
If you remain silent
If you seek the real meaning of
If you think for a moment
If you want to look
If you were asked to point out
If you will allow me to prophesy
If you will forgive me the expression
If you wish for a more interesting example
If you wish to get at the bottom of facts
If you would see the most conclusive proof
If your view is right
In a significant paragraph
In a wider sense
In a word, gentlemen
In a word, I conceive
In actual life, I suspect
In addition to these arguments
In addressing myself to the question
In addressing you I feel
In agreement with this obvious conclusion
In all ages of the world
In all or any of these views
In all times and places
In an unguarded moment
In answering the inquiry
In any view of the case
In closing my speech, I ask each of you
In conclusion, let me say
In conclusion, may I repeat
In consequence it becomes a necessity
In contemplating the causes
In days to come
In examining this part of the subject
In fine, it is no extravagance to say
In former ages and generations
In further illustration
In further proof of my assertion
In illustration of what I have said
In like manner are to be explained
In like manner I would advise
In listening to the kind words
In looking about me
In many instances
In meeting this difficulty, I will not urge
In most cases I hold
In my estimation
In my humble opinion
In my view
In offering to you these counsels
In one other respect
In one point I wish no one to mistake me
In one sense this is undoubtedly true
In order to appreciate the force of
In order to complete the proof
In order to do justice to the question
In order to prove plainly and intelligibly
In order to realize adequately
In other words
In our estimate of the past
In point of fact
In precisely the same way
In pursuance of these views
In pursuing the great objects
In regard to
In rising to return my sincere thanks
In saying all of this, I do not forget
In saying this, I am not disposed to deny
In short, I say
In solving this difficulty
In something of a parallel way
In spite of the fact
In such cases, strictly speaking
In support of this assertion
In that matchless epitome
In that mood of high hope
In the anomalies of fortune
In the course of these remarks
In the existing circumstances
In the first place, therefore, I consider
In the first place we see
In the first place, we should be all agreed
In the fullest sense
In the fullness of time
In the last suggestion
In the meantime I will commend to you
In the next place, be assured
In the presence of this vast assembly
In the present situation
In the progress of events
In the remarks I have made
In the same manner I rely
In the second place it is quite clear
In the suggestion I have made
In the very brief space at our disposal
In these extraordinary circumstances
In these sentiments I agree
In this brief survey
In this connection, I may be permitted to refer
In this connection I remind myself
In this necessarily brief and imperfect review
In this rapid and slight enumeration
In this respect
In this sense only
In this there is no contradiction
In very many instances
In very truth
In view of these reflections
In what has now been said
In what I have now further to say
In widening our view
Indeed, can anyone tell me
Indeed, I am not convinced
Indeed, I can not do better
Indeed, I have heard it whispered
Indeed, I may fairly say
Indeed, it will generally be found
Indeed we know
Instances abound
Is it logically consistent
Is it not legitimate to recognize
Is it not marvelous
Is it not obvious
Is it not quite possible
Is it not, then, preposterous
Is it not universally recognized
Is it not wise to argue
Is it possible, can it be believed
Is it, then, any wonder
Is not that the common sentiment
Is there any evidence here
Is there any language of reproach
Is there any possibility of mistaking
Is there any reason in the world
It affords me gratification
It also pleases me very much
It amounts to this
It appears from what has been said
It appears to me, on the contrary
It can rightly be said
It certainly follows, then
It comes to this
It could not be otherwise
It does not necessarily follow
It exhibits a state of mind
It follows as a matter of course
It follows inevitably
It gives us an exalted conception
It grieves me to relate
It hardly fits the character
It has at all times been a just reproach
It has been a very great pleasure for me
It has been generally assumed
It has been justly objected
It has been my privilege
It has been suggested fancifully
It has been well said
It has ever been my ambition
It has struck me very forcibly
It is a circumstance of happy augury	[augury = sign of something coming; omen]
It is a common error
It is a curious trait
It is a fact well known
It is a falsehood to say
It is a familiar charge against
It is a good augury of success	[augury = sign of something coming; omen]
It is a great pleasure to me
It is a living truth
It is a matter of absorbing interest
It is a matter of amusement
It is a matter of fact
It is a matter of just pride
It is a melancholy story
It is a memory I cherish
It is a mischievous notion
It is a mistake to suppose
It is a most extraordinary thing
It is a most pertinent question
It is a noble thing
It is a peculiar pleasure to me
It is a perversion of terms
It is a pleasing peculiarity
It is a popular idea
It is a rare privilege
It is a recognized principle
It is a remarkable and striking fact
It is a strange fact
It is a sure sign
It is a theme too familiar
It is a thing commonly said
It is a touching reflection
It is a true saying
It is a very significant fact
It is a vision which still inspires us
It is a wholesome symptom
It is, all things considered, a fact
It is all very fine to think
It is all very well to say
It is almost proverbial
It is also possible
It is also probably true
It is always pleasant to respond
It is amazing how little
It is an easy matter
It is an egregious mistake	[egregious = conspicuously and outrageously reprehensible]
It is an established rule
It is an incredible thing
It is an interesting fact
It is an unforgivable offense
It is an unquestionable truth
It is appropriate that we should celebrate
It is asserted
It is assumed as an axiom
It is at once inconsistent
It is but fair to say
It is but too true
It is by no means my design
It is certainly especially pleasant
It is certainly remarkable
It is common in these days to lament
It is commonly assumed
It is comparatively easy
It is curious sophistry
It is curious to observe
It is desirable for us
It is difficult for me to respond fitly
It is difficult to avoid saying
It is difficult to describe
It is difficult to overstate
It is difficult to put a limit
It is difficult to surmise
It is doubtful whether
It is easy enough to add
It is easy to instance cases
It is easy to understand
It is eminently proper
It is every man's duty to think
It is evident that the answer to this
It is evidently supposed by many people
It is exceedingly gratifying to hear
It is exceedingly unfortunate
It is fair that you should hear
It is fair to suppose
It is far from me to desire
It is fatal to suppose
It is fitting
It is for me to relate
It is for others to illustrate
It is for this reason
It is for us to ask
It is greatly assumed
It is gratifying to have the honor
It is hardly for me
It is hardly necessary to pass judgment
It is idle to think of
It is immaterial whether
It is impossible to avoid saying
It is in every way appropriate
It is in the highest degree worthy
It is in this characteristic
It is in vain
It is in your power to give
It is indeed a strange doctrine
It is indeed not a little remarkable
It is indeed true
It is indeed very clear
It is indispensable to have
It is interesting and suggestive
It is interesting to know
It is just so far true
It is likewise necessary
It is made evident
It is manifest
It is manifestly absurd to say
It is merely common sense to say
It is more than probable
It is my agreeable duty
It is my belief
It is my earnest wish
It is my grateful duty to address you
It is my hope
It is my present purpose
It is natural to ask the question
It is necessary to refer
It is necessary to take some notice
It is needful to a complete understanding
It is needless before this audience to repeat
It is no doubt true
It is no exaggeration to say
It is no part of my business
It is no significant thing
It is no small indication
It is no wonder
It is not a practical question
It is not altogether satisfactory
It is not an unknown occurrence
It is not by any means
It is not difficult to comprehend
It is not difficult to discern
It is not easy for me to find words
It is not enough to say
It is not entirely clear to me
It is not evident
It is not for me on this occasion
It is not given to many men
It is not likely that any of you
It is not logical to say
It is not my intention to enter into
It is not my purpose to discuss
It is not necessarily true
It is not necessary for me even to sketch
It is not necessary for our purpose
It is not often in these modern days
It is not ours to pronounce
It is not out of place to remind you
It is not possible to recount
It is not quite clear
It is not to me so very surprising
It is not too much to say
It is not unknown to you
It is not within the scope of this address
It is now high time for me
It is now perfectly plain
It is observable enough
It is obvious
It is of course difficult
It is of great importance to show
It is of no moment
It is of very little importance
It is often remarked
It is on these grounds
It is one of the burning questions of the day
It is one of the most natural visions
It is one of the most significant things
It is one of the queerest freaks of fate
It is only a few short years since
It is only just to say
It is our duty to examine
It is ours to bear witness
It is owing to this truth
It is peculiarly befitting at this time
It is perfectly apparent
It is pitiable to reflect
It is pleasant to meet this brilliant company
It is rather a pleasant coincidence
It is rather an arduous task
It is rather startling
It is related
It is ridiculous to say
It is said, and I think said truly
It is said to be impossible
It is satisfactory to notice
It is scarcely necessary to insist
It is scarcely questioned
It is self-evident
It is sometimes hard to determine
It is still an open question
It is still more surprising
It is substantially true
It is surely necessary for me
It is the clear duty of
It is the doctrine of
It is the fashion to extol
It is the universal testimony
It is therefore evident
It is therefore necessary
It is this which lies at the foundation
It is to be expected
It is to be remembered
It is to me a very sincere satisfaction
It is told traditionally
It is too plain to be argued
It is true
It is unnecessary for me to remind you
It is upon this line of reasoning
It is very common to confuse
It is very doubtful whether
It is very interesting and pleasant
It is well known
It is with great pleasure
It is with pity unspeakable
It is within the memory of men now living
It is worth while to notice
It may appear absurd
It may at first sight seem strange
It may be added
It may be conjectured
It may be imagined
It may be plausibly objected
It may be rightly said
It may be useful to trace
It may be worth your while to keep in view
It may indeed be unavoidable
It may not be altogether certain
It may not be uninteresting to any of you
It may or may not be true
It may, perhaps, seem wonderful
It may seem a little strange
It may still more probably be said
It must be a cause of delight
It must be borne in mind
It must be the verdict of history
It must create astonishment
It must doubtless be admitted
It must ever be recollected
It must never be forgotten
It must not be supposed
It must seem to every thoughtful man
It needs scarcely be said
It now becomes my pride and privilege
It only remains now to speak
It ought to animate us
It proves a great deal
It remains only to speak briefly
It remains that I inform you of
It remains that I should say a few words
It reminds me of an anecdote
It reminds one of the compliment
It requires no effort of imagination
It scarcely seems to be in keeping
It seems almost desperate to think of
It seems almost incredible
It seems now to be generally admitted
It seems strange to be told
It seems then that on the whole
It seems to me a striking circumstance
It seems to me idle to ask
It seems to me singularly appropriate
It seems to me the primary foundation
It seems to me unphilosophical
It should always be borne in mind
It should be remembered
It so happens
It sometimes seems to me
It still remains to be observed
It strikes me with wonder
It suggests at the outset
It summons our imagination
It surely is not too much to expect
It therefore astonishes me
It used to be a reproach
It was a brilliant answer
It was a fine and delicate rebuke
It was a fit and beautiful circumstance
It was a propitious circumstance	[propitious = auspicious, favorable]
It was certainly a gracious act
It was in the full understanding
It was my good fortune
It was not to be expected
It was said by one who ought to know
It was, therefore, inevitable
It was under these circumstances
It will appeal to
It will appear from what has been said
It will be asked me how
It will be easy to say too much
It will be easy to trace the influence
It will be evident to you
It will be idle to imply
It will be interesting to trace
It will be just as reasonable to say
It will be rather to our advantage
It will be recollected
It will be seen at a glance
It will be well and wise
It will carry out my meaning more fully
It will, I suppose, be denied
It will not be expected from me
It will not be safe
It will not do for a man to say
It will not, I trust, be concluded
It will not surely be objected
It will not take many words to sum up
It will thus be seen
It would be a misfortune
It would be a proud distinction
It would be a very remarkable fact
It would be absurd to pretend
It would be an inexcusable omission
It would be idle for me
It would be imprudent in me
It would be invidious for me	[invidious = rousing ill will, animosity]
It would be natural on such an occasion
It would be no less impracticable
It would be out of place here
It would be preposterous to say
It would be presumptuous in me
It would be the height of absurdity
It would be unfair to praise
It would be unjust to deny
It would be well for us to reflect
It would indeed be unworthy
It would seem perhaps most fitting
Just the reverse is true
Language is inadequate to voice my appreciation
Lastly, I do not understand
Lastly, it can not be denied
Less than this could not be said
Lest I should be accused of quibbling
Let all of us labor in this work
Let anyone imagine to himself
Let anyone who doubts
Let everyone consider
Let it be clearly understood, I repeat it
Let it be remembered
Let it not be objected
Let it not be supposed that I impute	[impute = relate to a particular cause or source]
Let me add another thing
Let me add my final word
Let me add one other hint
Let me also say a word in regard
Let me answer these questions
Let me ask you to imagine
Let me ask your leave to propose
Let me be allowed to devote a few words
Let me call attention to another fact
Let me commend to you
Let me direct your attention now to
Let me entreat you to examine
Let me give one more instance
Let me give one parting word
Let me give you an illustration
Let me here make one remark
Let me here say
Let me hope that I have said enough
Let me illustrate again
Let me make myself distinctly understood
Let me make use of an illustration
Let me not be thought offensive
Let me now conclude with
Let me once more urge upon you
Let me protest against the manner
Let me quite temperately defend
Let me rather make the supposition
Let me say a practical word
Let me simply declare
Let me tell you an interesting reminiscence
Let me thank you once more
Let me urge you earnestly
Let no man congratulate himself
Let our conception be enlarged
Let our object be
Let that question be answered by
Let the facts be granted
Let these instances suffice
Let this be the record made
Let this inspire us with abhorrence of
Let us approach the subject from another side
Let us attempt a survey
Let us be perfectly just
Let us be quite practical
Let us bear perpetually in mind
Let us begin at the beginning
Let us begin by examining
Let us briefly review
Let us brush aside once for all
Let us cherish
Let us confirm our opinion
Let us consider for a moment
Let us devote ourselves
Let us discard all prejudice
Let us do all we can
Let us draw an illustration
Let us endeavor to understand
Let us enumerate
Let us figure to ourselves
Let us for the moment put aside
Let us get a clear understanding
Let us heed the voice
Let us hope and believe
Let us hope that future generations
Let us imitate
Let us inquire also
Let us labor and pray
Let us likewise remember
Let us look briefly at a few particulars
Let us look nearer home
Let us not be fearful
Let us not be misled
Let us not be misunderstood
Let us not flatter ourselves
Let us not for a moment forget
Let us not limit our view
Let us now apply the views presented
Let us now consider the characteristics
Let us now see the results
Let us now turn our consideration
Let us observe this analogy
Let us pass on to another fact
Let us pause a moment
Let us push the inquiry yet further
Let us rather listen to
Let us reflect how vain
Let us remember this
Let us remind ourselves
Let us resolve
Let us scrutinize the facts
Let us suppose, for argument's sake
Let us suppose the case to be
Let us take, for instance
Let us, then, be assured
Let us, then, be worthy of
Let us, therefore, say once for all
Let us try to form a mental picture
Let us turn to the contemplation of
Let your imagination realize
Like all citizens of high ideals
Likely enough
Little wonder therefore
Long have I been convinced
Look at it in another way
Look at some of these questions
Look at the situation
Mainly, I believe
Making allowances for differences of opinion
Many of us have had the good fortune
Many of you, perhaps, recollect
May I ask you to believe
May I not speak here
May I try to show that every effort
May I venture to suggest
May it not also be advanced
May the day come quickly
Meantime it is encouraging to think
Meanwhile let us freely recognize
Men are in the habit of saying
Men are telling us nowadays
Men everywhere testify
More and more it is felt
More than once have I had to express
More than this need not be said
Moreover, I have insisted
Moreover, I would counsel you
Moreover, when we pass judgment
Much has been said and written about
My appreciation has been quickened
My belief, therefore, is
My duty is to endeavor to show
My experience tells me
My first duty is to express to you
My friends, do you really believe
My friends, I propose
My heart tells me
My idea, therefore, is
My last criticism upon
My mind is not moved by
My mind most perfectly acquiesces
My next objection is
My own private opinion is
My present business is
My regret is intensified by the thought
Nay, I boldly say
Nay, it will be a relief to my mind
Nay, there is a general feeling
Need I say that I mean
Neither should you deceive
Never before have I so strongly felt
Never can I cease to feel
Never did there devolve
Never for a moment believe
Never have I felt so forcibly
Never was a weaker defense attempted
Never was there a greater mistake
Never was there an instance
Nevertheless we can admit
Next, from what has been said it is plain
Next, I consider
Next, it will be denied
No argument can overwhelm a fact
No defense is to be found
No distinct test can be named
No doubt, in the first instance
No doubt there are many questions
No doubt to most of us
No finer sentence has come down to us
No greater service could be rendered
No longer do we believe
No man regrets more than I do
No one can feel this more strongly
No one can, I think, pretend
No one can see the end
No one here, I am sure
No one, I suppose, would say
No one, I think, can fail to observe
No one, I think, will dispute the statement
No one need to exaggerate
No one will accuse me
No true man ever believes
None can have failed to observe
Nor am I disparaging or discouraging
Nor can I forget either
Nor can it justly be said
Nor can we afford to waste time
Nor can we forget how long
Nor can we now ask
Nor do I believe
Nor do I doubt
Nor do I pretend
Nor do I think there can be found
Nor does it matter much
Nor has there been wanting
Nor indeed am I supposing
Nor is it a fair objection
Nor is it probable
Nor is this all
Nor let me forget to add here
Nor must I be understood as saying
Nor must it be forgotten
Nor need we fear to speak
Nor should any attempt be made
Nor will history fail to record
Nor will I enlarge on the matter
Not at all
Not only so
Not that I quarrel with
Nothing but the deepest sense
Nothing can be further from the truth
Nothing could be clearer
Nothing could be more striking
Nothing is more common in the world
Nothing that you can do
Notwithstanding all that has been said
Notwithstanding all this, I hold
Now, bear with me when I say
Now comes the question
Now, comparing these instances together
Now, from these instances it is plain
Now, having spoken of
Now, I admit
Now, I am far from denying
Now, I am far from undervaluing
Now, I am justified in calling this
Now, I am obliged to say
Now, I do not wish you to believe
Now, I have a closing sentence or two
Now, I pass on to consider
Now, I shall not occupy your time
Now, I understand the argument
Now, I will undertake to say
Now, I wish to call your attention
Now, if you will clearly understand
Now, is there any ground or basis for
Now, it is an undoubted fact
Now, it is evident
Now, it is not at all strange
Now, it is unquestioned
Now, let me speak with the greatest care
Now, let me stop a moment
Now, let us consider
Now, observe, my drift
Now, sir, I am truly horrified
Now, the answer we should give
Now, the question here at issue
Now, the world will say
Now, there is a close alliance between
Now, this is precisely the danger
Now, this is to some extent
Now, understand me definitely
Now, we do not maintain
Now, we will inquire
Now, what I want you to realize
Now, with regard to
Now, you will allow me to state
Now, you will understand from this
Observe again
Occasionally you ought to read
Of course I am aware
Of course I am putting an impossible case
Of course I can not be taken to mean
Of course I do not maintain
Of course I do not stop here
Of course I would not allow
Of course much may be said
Of course these remarks hold good
Of course we may, if we please
Of course you will sympathize
Of one thing, however, I am certain
Of this briefly
Of this statement I will only say
Of this truth I shall convince you by
On a review of the whole subject
On occasions of this kind
On such a day as this
On the contrary, I am assuming
On the occasion to which I refer
On the other hand, it is clear
On the whole, then, I observe
On this auspicious occasion
On this point I do not mean to dwell
On this subject you need not suspect
Once again, there are those
Once more I emphasize
Once more let me try to put into words
One additional remark
One almost wishes
One can not decline to note
One concluding remark has to be made
One fact is clear and indisputable
One further word
One important topic remains
One is fairly tempted to wish
One lesson history may be said to repeat
One might be challenged to produce
One of the ancients said
One of the most commonly known
One of the most extraordinary incidents
One of the things I recollect with most pride
One of these signs is the fact
One or two points are made clear
One other circumstance
One other remark suggests itself
One remark I will make
One thing more will complete this question
One thing which always impressed me
One very striking tendency
One word in courtesy I must say
One word more in a serious vein
One would naturally suppose
Only so much do I know
Opinions are divided as to whether
Or to come nearer home
Or to take but one other example
Ordinarily speaking, such deductions
Others may hold other opinions
Ought we not to think
Our thoughts wander back
Over and above all this
Pardon me if
Perhaps another reason why
Perhaps, however, in speaking to you
Perhaps, however, some among you will be
Perhaps I may be best able to illustrate
Perhaps I ought to say
Perhaps it may be doubted
Perhaps, sir, I am mistaken in
Permit me frankly to say
Permit me to add another circumstance
Permit me to bring home to you
Personally, I am far too firm a believer
Pray, sir, let me say
Read but your history aright
Recollect, sir
Reflections such as these
Rely upon it
Remember, I do not seek to
Remembering some past occurrences
Returning, then, to the consideration
Seriously, then, do I beg you
Shall I tell you
Shall we complain
Should there be objection, I answer
Since, then, it is provided
Since, then, this is the case
Sir, with all my heart, I respond
So accustomed are we
So at least it seems to me
So far as I know
So far as my observation and experience goes
So far in general
So I say to you
So it comes to pass
So long as we continue to love truth and duty
So men are asking
So much at first sight
So much on this subject
So that I may venture to say
So that if you were persuaded
So then ought we also
So, to add one other example
So, too, I may go on to speak
So when I hear people say
Some have insisted
Some of you can recall the time
Some of you may think this visionary
Some of you will remember
Some one will perhaps object
Some prejudice is attached
Some writer has said
Sometimes I venture to think
Sometimes it may happen
Speaking in this place
Startling as this may appear to you
Stating only the truth, I affirm
Still another encouraging fact
Still further
Still I can not part from my subject
Still I have generally found
Still I imagine you would consider it
Still I know what answer I can make to
Still it may with justice be said
Still one thing more
Still we ought to be grateful
Strange as it may seem
Strictly in confidence, I do not think
Strictly speaking, there is no such thing
Such a doctrine is essentially superficial
Such are the rather tolerant ideas
Such considerations as these
Such, I believe, would be the consequences
Such illustrations are not frequent
Such, in brief, is the story
Such is steadfastly my opinion
Such is the deep prejudice now existing
Such is the intellectual view we take
Such is the lesson which I am taught
Such is the progress
Such is the truth
Such, sir, I conceive to be
Such, then, is the true idea
Such, too, is the characteristic of
Suffer me to point out
Suffice it to say here
Summing up what I have said
Suppose we turn our eyes to
Surely I do not misinterpret
Surely it is a paradox
Surely it is not too much for me to say
Take another instance
Take one of the most recent cases
Take the simple fact
Take this example
Taking a broader view
Taking the facts by themselves
That is a further point
That is a natural boast
That is a pure assumption
That is all that it seems necessary to me
That is all very good
That is far from my thoughts
That is final and conclusive
That is the lesson of history
That is the question of questions
That you may conceive the force of
The answer is easy to find
The answer is ready
The belief is born of the wish
The broad principle which I would lay down
The circumstances under which we meet
The climax of my purpose in this address
The common consent of civilized mankind
The conclusion is irresistible
The confusing assertion is sometimes made
The day is at hand
The decided objection is raised
The doctrine I am combating
The doctrine is admirable
The effect too often is
The evolution of events has brought
The fact has made a deep impression on me
The fact has often been insisted
The fact to be particularly noted
The facts are clear and unequivocal
The facts may be strung together
The first business of every man
The first counsel I would offer
The first great fact to remember is
The first point to be ascertained
The first practical thought is
The first remarkable instance was
The first thing I wish to note
The first thing that we have to consider
The future historian will, no doubt
The generous feeling that has promoted you
The great mass of the people
The hour is at hand
The illustration is analogous
The important thing is
The instance I shall choose
The irresistible tendency of
The kindness with which I have been received
The last and distinguishing feature is
The latest inclination I have seen
The lesson which we should take most to heart
The main cause of all this
The more you examine this matter
The most concise tribute paid
The most reasonable anticipation
The most remarkable step forward
The most striking characteristic
The most sublime instance that I know
The next point is
The next question to be considered is
The next thing I consider indispensable
The occasion that calls us together
The one central difference between
The only course that remains open
The only plea to be offered
The other day I observed
The paramount consideration is
The perils that beset us here
The pleasing duty is assigned me
The point I have urged upon you is
The point I wish a little further to speak of
The point to which I shall call your attention
The popular notion is
The practical inference from all this
The presence of this brilliant assemblage
The pressing question is
The prevalent opinion, no doubt
The proof of this statement is to be found
The question is deeply involved
The question, then, recurs
The remedy I believe to be
The result, I fancy, has been
The result of the whole
The rule will always hold good
The sacred voice of inspiration
The same is true in respect of
The scene all comes back
The sentiment to which I am to respond
The sentiment which you have expressed
The simple rule and test
The simple truth is
The soundness of this doctrine depends
The strongest proof I have
The subject of the evening's address
The subject which has been assigned to me
The task has been placed in my hands
The testimony of history is
The theory seems at first sight
The thought with which I shall close
The time has manifestly now arrived
The time is not far distant
The time is now come for me
The times are full of signs and warnings
The toast I am about to propose to you
The vain wish has sometimes been indulged
The view I have been enforcing
The view is more misleading
The warmth and kindness of your reception
The welcome that has been extended to me
The whole story of civilization
Then again, in corroboration
Then again, when men say
Then take the other side of the argument
Then the question arises
Then there is another story
Then, too, it must be remembered
There are certain old truths
There are few spectacles
There are hopeful signs of
There are, I believe, many who think
There are, indeed, exceptions
There are, indeed, persons who profess
There are many educated and intelligent people
There are people in every community
There are several reasons why
There are some slight modifications
There are some who are fond of looking at
There are some who have an idea
There are those of us who can remember
There are those who wish
There are two conflicting theories
There can be but one answer
There can be no doubt
There has been a great deal of discussion lately
There has been no period of time
There have been differences of opinion
There is a characteristic saying
There is a class of person
There is a common saying
There is a conviction
There is a degree of evidence
There is a genuine grief
There is a great deal of rash talking
There is a growing disposition
There is a large class of thinkers
There is a lesson of profound interest
There is a more important question
There is a most serious lesson
There is a multitude of facts
There is a question of vital importance
There is a very common tendency
There is a vital difference of opinion
There is an analogy in this respect
There is an ancient story to the effect
There is an eternal controversy
There is another class of men
There is another factor
There is another object equally important
There is another point of view
There is another remarkable analogy
There is another sense in which
There is, at any rate, to be said
There is but one consideration
There is certainly no reason
There is hardly any limit
There is, however, another opinion
There is, however, one caution
There is little truth in
There is no field of human activity
There is no good reason
There is no justification for
There is no mistaking the purpose
There is no more insidious peril
There is no more striking exemplification
There is no occasion to exaggerate
There is no page of history
There is no sense in saying
There is no worse perversion
There is not a shadow of evidence
There is nothing more repulsive
There is nothing overstated in this description
There is nothing to show
There is one story which it is said
There is only one sense in which
There is some difference of opinion
There is something strangely interesting
There is yet another distinction
There is yet one other remark
There ought certainly to be
There was but one alternative
There was one remarkable incident
There will always be a number of men
There will be no difficulty
There yet remains
Therefore, there is no possibility of a doubt
Therein lies your responsibility
These alone would not be sufficient
These are enough to refute the opinion
These are general counsels
These are generalizations
These are my reasons for
These are points for consideration
These considerations have great weight with me
These exceptions do not hold in the case of
These ideas naturally present themselves
These instances are far from common
These instances are indications
These last words lead me to say
These objections only go to show
These questions I shall examine
These various partial views
They mistake the intelligence
They would persuade you to
Think for a moment
Think of the cool disregard
This absurdity arises
This appeal to the common sense
This argument is especially cogent	[cogent = powerfully persuasive]
This, at least, is sure
This being the case
This being true
This being undeniable, it is plain
This being understood, I ask
This brings me to a single remark
This brings us to a subject
This episode goes to prove
This fact was soon made manifest
This from the nature of the case
This I conceive to be the business
This I consider to be my own case
This I have told you
This is a general statement
This is a very one-sided conception
This is a very serious situation
This is an astonishing announcement
This is conceded by
This is contrary to all argument
This is doubtless the truth
This is especially the case
This is essentially an age of
This is in the main just
This is like saying
This is not all
This is not the main point of objection
This is not the occasion or the place
This is obvious
This is on the whole reasonable
This is only another illustration of
This is owing in great measure to
This is precisely what we ought to do
This is said in no spirit of
This is suggested to us
This is the design and intention
This is the great fact
This is the main point on which the inquiry turns
This is the meaning of
This is the obvious answer
This is the point I want to impress upon you
This is the point of view
This is the position of our minds
This is the radical question
This is the sentiment of mankind
This is the starting-point
This is the sum
This is to be found in the fact
This is what I am led to say
This is what may be objected
This is why I take the liberty
This language is plain
This leads me to the question
This leads us to inquire
This may be said without prejudice
This might be illustrated at length
This much is certain
This sentiment was well-nigh universal
This, surely, is the conclusion
This, then, is the answer
This, then, is the drift of my illustration
This, then, is what I mean by saying
This will be evident at once
This you can not deny
Those who have watched the tendencies
Thus a great deal may be done
Thus analogy suggests
Thus far, I willingly admit
Thus I am led on to another remark
Thus if you look into
Thus instances occur now and then
Thus it comes to pass
Thus my imagination tells me
Thus much, however, I may say
Thus much I may be allowed to say
Thus much may be sufficient to recall
Thus we see
Time would not permit me
To a man of the highest public spirit
To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood
To be more explicit
To be sure, we sometimes hear
To bring the matter nearer home
To convince them of this
To feel the true force of this argument
To illustrate
To make my story quite complete
To me, however, it would appear
To my way of conceiving such matters
To prevent misapprehension
To some it may sound like a paradox
To sum up all that has been said
To sum up in one word
To take a very different instance
To the conclusion thus drawn
To the enormous majority of persons
To these general considerations
To this I answer
To this it will be replied
To what other cause can you ascribe
To-day, as never before
Treading close upon the heels
Tried by this standard
True it is
True, there are difficulties
Truly it is a subject for astonishment
Two things are made very clear
Under all the circumstances
Under these favoring conditions
Under this head
Undoubtedly we may find
Unfortunately it is a truth
Unless I could be sure
Up to this moment I have stated
Very strange is this indeed
We all agree as to
We all feel the force of the maxim
We all in equal sincerity profess
We almost shudder when we see
We are accustomed to lay stress upon
We are all familiar with
We are approaching an era
We are apt to forget
We are assembled here to-day
We are beginning to realize
We are bound to give heed
We are constantly being told
We are fulfilling what I believe to be
We are in the habit of saying
We are met to-night
We are not able to prove
We are not disinterested
We are quite unable to speculate
We are told emphatically
We are tolerably certain
We believe with a sincere belief
We can but pause to contemplate
We can imagine the amazement of
We can not but be struck with
We can not escape the truth
We can not have this too deeply fixed
We can not too highly honor the temper of
We can not wonder
We can only applaud the sentiment
We can only bow with awe
We can presume
We can remember with pride
We can see to some extent
We continually hear nowadays
We deeply appreciate the circumstances of
We do not quarrel with those
We do not question the reality
We do well to recall
We easily persuade ourselves
We feel keenly about such things
We grope blindly along
We have a firm assurance
We have a right to claim
We have an overpowering sense
We have been accustomed to
We have been told by more than one
We have come together to-night
We have great reason to be thankful
We have heard lately
We have here plain proof
We have need to examine
We have no means of knowing
We have no other alternative
We have not yet solved the problem
We have sought on this occasion
We have the evidence of this
We have the good fortune to-night
We have to admit
We have witnessed on many occasions
We hear it is said sometimes
We hear no complaint
We heartily wish and mean
We hold fast to the principle
We laugh to scorn the idea
We may all of us agree
We may be permitted to remember
We may contemplate with satisfaction
We may have a deep consciousness
We may indeed consider
We may not know precisely how
We must also look
We must constantly direct our purpose
We must not be deceived
We must not mistake
We must realize conscientiously
We must remember
We need no proof to assure us
We need not look far for reasons
We need not trouble ourselves
We of this generation
We often hear persons say
We ought in strict propriety
We pride ourselves upon the fact
We rightly pay all honor
We see in a variety of ways
We shall all doubtless concede
We shall be blind not to perceive
We shall do well to remember
We shall have no difficulty in determining
We should be convinced
We should contemplate and compare
We should dread nothing so much
We should lend our influence
We should not question for a moment
We should not, therefore, question
We stand astonished at
We stumble and falter and fall
We take it for granted
We will not stop to inquire
Weighty as these conditions are
Well, gentlemen, it must be confessed
Well may we explain
Well, now, let us propose
Well, that being the case, I say
Were I to enter into a detailed description
Were I to speculate
What are the precise characteristics
What are we to think of
What are you going to do
What can avail
What can be more intelligible
What can be more monstrous than
What can I say better
What commonly happens is this
What could be more captivating
What could be more true
What do we gain by
What do we understand to have been
What I mean is this
What I now say is
What I object to is
What I propose to do is
What I shall actually attempt to show here
What I suggest is
What is more important
What is more remarkable
What is the pretext
What is this but to say
What more shall I say
What remains but to wish you
What strikes the mind so forcibly
What, then, are we to believe
What, then, can be the reason
What, then, I may be asked
What, then, is the use
What, then, was the nature of
What was the consequence of
What we are concerned to know is
What we have most to complain of
What would you say
Whatever a man thinks
Whatever difference of opinion may exist
Whatever opinion I may express
Whatever the truth may be
When I am told
When I hear it said
When I remember the history
When I review these circumstances
When I speak of this question
When I thus profess myself
When one remembers
When we consider the vastness
When we contemplate
When we get so far as this
When we look closely at
When will men understand
When you are assured
When you did me the honor to invite me
Whence it is, I say
Whence was the proof to come
While acknowledging the great value
While I feel most keenly the honor
While I have hinted to you
Whilst I am on this matter
Who can deny the effect
Who can say in a word
Who does not like to see
Who has not felt the contrast
Who that reads does not see
Who will accuse me
Why, again, should I take notice
Why need you seek to disprove
Will any gentleman say
Will anyone answer
Will it be whispered
Will it not be well for us
Will you allow me to present to you
Will you bear with me
Will you mistake this
Will you permit me to thank you
With all my heart I share
With possibly a single exception
With respect to what has been said
With this ideal clearly before us
With whatever opinions we come here
Without going into any details
Without my saying a word more
Yet I am convinced
Yet I am willing to admit
Yet I am willing to conclude
Yet I feel quite free to say
Yet I, for one, do not hesitate to admit
Yet I have never been thoroughly satisfied
Yet I suppose it is worth while
Yet I would have to think
Yet if you were to ask the question
Yet it is instructive and interesting
Yet it is no less true
Yet it is perfectly plain
Yet let me consider what consequences must
Yet may I not remind you
You all know the history of
You and I are always contrasting
You are at a parting of the ways
You are now invited to do honor
You can never forget
You can not assert
You do not need to be told
You have all read the story
You have been gracious enough to assign to me
You have been mindful
You have been pleased to confer upon me
You have but to observe
You have done me great honor
You have no right
You have not forgotten
You have often pondered over
You have sometimes been astonished
You know that it is impossible to
You know the legend which has grown up
You know very well
You may also be assured
You may be acquainted with
You may be sure
You may depend upon it
You may remember
You may well be proud
You may well study the example
You might apply to yourselves
You must not forget
You must understand I do not mean to claim
You ought not to disregard what I say
You remember how
You will allow me to say with becoming brevity
You will be pleased to hear
You will bear me out when I say
You will clearly understand
You will expect me to say something about
You will forgive me
You will join with me, I trust
You will observe
You will pardon me, I am sure
You will scarcely be surprised
You would never dream of urging
You yourselves are the evidence
Your friendly and generous words
Your good sense must tell you
Your presence seems to say
